## Overview

This was legitimately the longest it's ever taken me to finish one of these. I finished the design and layout in an hour, but the error states took me another two. After all my googles I decided to go with wrapping an input and span with a div, and using a bunch of CSS to style it when the input was not valid.

Since this is a newbie problem, I think I may have taken the path of most resistance but I'm honestly not sure.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned I didn't have a good base knowledge of how to add images to an input field. Then I learned inputs don't have content, so you have to have a parent container wrapping it and the borders from the input removed.

Normally, these take me a solid 40-50 minutes to do but the error state in the input stumped me for a bit.

### Continued development

I'm gonna watch some videos about inputs and form styling. Then continue the flexbox and grid journey.
